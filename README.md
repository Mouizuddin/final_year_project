# Fake News Detection

Fake News Detection in Python

In this project, we have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using scikit-learn libraries in Python.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

### Python 3.6

- This setup requires that your machine has Python 3.6 installed on it. You can refer to this [URL](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download Python. Once you have Python downloaded and installed, you will need to set up PATH variables (if you want to run Python programs directly). Detailed instructions are below in the "How to Run Software" section. To do that, check this: [Add Python to PATH](https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/).
- Setting up the PATH variable is optional as you can also run the program without it. More instructions are given below on this topic.

### Anaconda

- The second and easier option is to download Anaconda and use its Anaconda Prompt to run the commands. To install Anaconda, check this [URL](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

- You will also need to download and install the following packages after you install either Python or Anaconda from the steps above:

  - `scikit-learn`
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`

If you have chosen to install Python 3.6, then run the following commands in Command Prompt/Terminal to install these packages:

```sh
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
